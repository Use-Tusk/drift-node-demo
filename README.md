# Tusk Drift Demo - Node.js Service

Welcome to the Tusk Drift demo! This repository demonstrates how Tusk Drift automatically generates API tests from real traffic, helping you catch regressions before they reach production.

**üöÄ Get started in under 5 minutes** - no recording setup required!

## What You'll Experience

This demo includes a simple Express.js API service that integrates with external APIs. You'll:

1. ‚úÖ Run realistic API tests in seconds (no setup needed!)
2. üêõ See how Tusk catches bugs by detecting API behavior changes
3. üìö Learn how to record your own tests from real traffic
4. ‚òÅÔ∏è Discover Tusk Cloud's intelligent test suite management

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.6.0+ (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- npm

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo.git
cd drift-node-demo

# Install Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Install Tusk CLI

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

Download the latest release from [Tusk CLI Releases](https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli/releases/latest)

Full installation guide: [Tusk CLI Installation](https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

### 3. Run the Tests

This repository includes **pre-recorded test traces** from real API traffic (in `.tusk/traces`), so you can see Tusk Drift in action immediately without recording anything yourself.

```bash
# Run all pre-recorded API tests
tusk run
```

You should see output showing tests running against the Express server with deterministic mocks.

**üéâ Success!** You just replayed real API tests with zero setup.

> **Note:** These tests were recorded from actual API calls made to this service. Later in this guide, we'll show you how to record your own tests from scratch.

## What's Happening Under the Hood?

This demo includes:

- **Express.js Server** (`server.ts`) - API service with multiple external integrations
- **Pre-recorded Traces** (`.tusk/traces/`) - Real API call recordings in JSONL format
- **Tusk Configuration** (`.tusk/config.yaml`) - Service configuration for test replay

When you run `tusk run`, the CLI:

1. Starts your Express server (using configuration in `.tusk/config.yaml`)
2. Replays the recorded inbound HTTP requests
3. Mocks all outbound requests (external APIs or database calls) using recorded responses
4. Compares actual vs. expected API responses
5. Reports any deviations

## Detecting Bugs with Tusk

Want to see Tusk catch a bug? Switch to the `buggy-branch` branch:

```bash
git checkout buggy-branch
tusk run
```

This branch introduces a subtle bug by converting the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Tusk will detect the deviation in the `/api/weather-activity` endpoint and mark the test as failed.

## How Tusk Drift Works

Tusk Drift consists of three components:

### 1. **Tusk Drift SDK** (Recording)

The SDK instruments your application to record all inbound and outbound traffic:

- **Inbound requests**: HTTP requests to your service (headers, body, query params)
- **Outbound requests**: External API calls, database queries, etc.
- **Deterministic Replay**: Records responses for exact replay during testing
- **Minimal Overhead**: Low sampling rates for production use
- **PII Protection**: Redact sensitive data and blacklist endpoints

[See full list of supported packages ‚Üí](https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-sdk#requirements)

### 2. **Tusk CLI** (Replay)

The CLI replays recorded traces against your service:

- Spins up your service locally
- Sends the recorded inbound requests
- Intercepts outbound calls and returns mocked responses
- Detects deviations in API responses

**Key Commands:**
- `tusk init` - Initialize Tusk for a new service
- `tusk list` - List available traces
- `tusk run` - Replay local traces


### 3. **Tusk Cloud** (Optional)

Cloud features include:

- **Automatic Test Suite Creation**: Intelligently selects representative traces from user traffic
- **CI/CD Integration**: Run tests in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. with PR comments showing test results
- **Deviation Classification**: AI-powered classification of failing tests as intended/unintended + auto-fixes
- **Test Maintenance**: Automatically updates/removes outdated tests

## Recording Your Own Tests

This demo uses pre-recorded traces, but you can record new ones for this service from real traffic:

### 1. Start in Record Mode

```bash
npm run start:record
```

This sets `TUSK_DRIFT_MODE=record` and starts the server.

### 2. Generate Traffic

```bash
# Make some API calls
curl http://localhost:3000/api/weather-activity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/post/5
```

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. Your newly recorded traces are now in `.tusk/traces/`!

### 3. View and Replay Tests

View the newly recorded tests:

```bash
tusk list
```

Replay the tests:

```bash
tusk run
```

## Next Steps

### Use Tusk on Your Own Service

1. **Install the SDK**: Follow the [Node SDK setup guide](https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-sdk#installation)

```bash
npm install @use-tusk/drift-node-sdk
```

2. **Initialize the SDK**: Create an initialization file

```typescript
import { TuskDrift } from "@use-tusk/drift-node-sdk";

TuskDrift.initialize({
  // Optional: No API key needed for local recording and replay. Only required for cloud features.
  // apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

export { TuskDrift };
```

3. **Import at Entry Point**: Load the SDK before your application starts

```typescript
import { TuskDrift } from './tdInit';
// ... rest of your imports

// After your server starts listening:
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  TuskDrift.markAppAsReady();
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

4. **Record in staging/dev**: Deploy with recording enabled
5. **Replay in CI**: Add `tusk run` to your test pipeline
6. **Catch regressions**: Get notified when API behavior changes

## FAQ

### Do I need to modify my application code?

Minimal changes - just initialize the SDK at startup and call `TuskDrift.markAppAsReady()` when your app is ready to accept requests.

### What about PII and sensitive data?

Tusk supports PII and sensitive data masking. You can:

- Blacklist specific endpoints
- Configure custom redaction rules based on request/response patterns
- Keep all data local (no cloud export)

### Can I use this in production?

Yes! Use a low sampling rate (e.g., 0.01 for 1%) to minimize overhead. Most teams start by recording in staging/dev environments and then switch to production traffic to capture representative traffic.

### What about non-deterministic data (timestamps, UUIDs)?

Tusk has built-in rules for dynamic fields. You can customize these in `.tusk/config.yaml` to handle application-specific dynamic data.


### How does this compare to traditional mocking?

Traditional mocking requires:
- Manual mock creation and maintenance
- Keeping mocks in sync with real APIs
- Guessing at edge cases

Tusk Drift:
- Automatically captures real API behavior
- Updates tests based on actual traffic
- Finds edge cases you didn't know existed
